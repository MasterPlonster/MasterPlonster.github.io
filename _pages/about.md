I help companies build AI-powered products or adopt AI in their operations. I've worked with startups small and large across a variety of industries, including healthcare, B2B SaaS, and e-commerce.

In 2019 I co-founded ART AI, where we were the first company to launch a text to image generator back in 2020, leading the way in generative AI.

Before that, I studied Biostatistics in Cambridge and worked on statistical methodology and applications in genetics.
